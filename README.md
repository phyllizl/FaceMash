# Rank Your MPs

Please take this with a pinch of salt! We are on a misson to find the most unlikeable politician in Parliament.
Our ranking system is based of the Elo Formula (used in chess games). The rankings are based of users input! 

## Description

Heard of FaceMash? It is Zuckerberg's pet project in Harvard that gets users to choose the "hotter" of 2 female students in his college. Tsk.

RankYourMPs replicates FaceMash's functionality to create a rating system that gives users 2 politicians to choose from. Users just have to click on the MP they like better. This automatically updates the database, and 2 new MPs are rendered for users to choose from again.
